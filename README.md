# Sway Input Configurator

Input device configurator for [SwayWM](https://swaywm.org/), written in Python and Qt5/PySide2, inspired by [nwg-shell-config](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-shell-config). It uses standard [libinput](https://www.mankier.com/5/sway-input) options to configure keyboard, touchpad and pointer devices.

If **settings** file is corrupted or missing, Sway Input Configurator will use the default settings and recreate **settings** file. Config files for keyboard, touchpad and mouse is located in `~/.config/sway/` (`keyboard`, `touchpad` and `pointer` respectively).

## Translations

If you would like to translate Sway Input Configurator into your language, please follow the instructions below:

* Install the necessary utilities - Qt Linguist and pylupdate5. For Debian-based systems:

`sudo apt install pyqt5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools`

* Clone the repository and generate translation:

```
git clone git@github.com:Sunderland93/sway-input-config.git
cd sway-input-config
./locale-gen.sh
```

It creates `lang_*.ts` file in `sway_input_config/langs` based on your system locale. If you want to create translation other than your system locale, pass `yourlocale` option to `locale-gen` script (e.g for German, you can pass `de_DE`):

`./locale-gen.sh de_DE`

* Open created `lang_*.ts` file in Qt Linguist tool, choose language and translate all strings. After that, select File -> Compile and save your `lang_*.qm` file in the same directory as `lang_*.ts` (`sway_input_config/langs`).

* Test your translation. If your translation is the same as your system locale, Sway Input Configurator apply it automatically. Or you can pass `--locale "yourlocale"` option to Sway Input Configurator to force the locale (e.g `--locale de_DE`).

* Feel free to send PR with your translation :)
